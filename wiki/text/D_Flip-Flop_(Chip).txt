The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)#D_flip-flop D flip-flop] captures the value of the D-input at a rising edge portion of the clock cycle .
That captured value becomes the D flip-flop's output. At other times, the output 0does not change.
The D flip-flop can be viewed as a memory cell where the clock input triggers the saving process.

Change the D input by clicking on the button left to the chip and save the state to the
D flip-flop by bushing the button below the chip.
