This FAQ is designed to answer many questions that you may have. I absolutely hope that this is a useful resource to anyone who is new to Electrical Age.

==Can I have a copy of the MC 1.12 version | Are there any alphas/betas available?==

Electrical Age for Minecraft 1.12 is absolutely positively ''not'' ready for use, and isn't even close to playable. We will notify the community as soon as there are available testing versions for 1.12.

==Is Electrical Age being ported to X Minecraft version?==

Electrical Age is currently (as of August 8th, 2019) slowly being ported to Minecraft 1.12. It will not be ported to 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, or earlier versions than 1.7.10. It is currently unknown if there will be continued updates to the 1.7.10 version once the 1.12 version is available.

==When is Electrical Age adding AC voltage? | Why don't you implement 3 phase?==

Electrical Age is not going to be adding AC voltage for various reasons. The first is that Minecraft only runs at a 20Hz simulation frequency (a tick), and Electrical Age follows this frequency with its internal simulator. While various internal parts of Electrical Age periodically run faster, this is not reflected to the player, and it only makes the solver more stable as it solves for the solution to active components (since MNA is designed for passive components).

Because Electrical Age only runs at 20Hz, the best clean wave you can create is a 10Hz square wave. One other current limitation is that diodes are not simulated fast enough, and they require 1 tick to react. So achieving waves faster than 5Hz is not possible, and frequencies above 1Hz can cause major problems with short circuits. Beyond that, if you want to have a really slow wave, you can totally have AC power in Electrical Age, but it doesn't come with any of the benefits of real life (which is mostly due to the inductance that can be used in proper transformers that makes it easy to convert from one voltage to another). We also don't really have much that can receive AC voltage, and due to the way that Inter-System MNA solves work in Electrical Age, it would be impossible to transmit over long distances on things like poles without causing your server's TPS to go to about 0.3.

==What fuels are supported with Electrical Age?==

==I can't get X to work | Build me an X kW generator NOW==

==Can I pay you to implement X feature? | Can I pay you to port the mod? | Can I donate?==

Currently, the developers of Electrical Age are not looking for monetary contributions, and forking over the cash would not make things go faster.

We do not currently have a system set up for donations, but one could donate their time to helping us with various things we need help with (see below).

==How can I be of help? | How can I make porting or implementing X feature faster?==

We are looking for:

* translators for various languages besides American English.
* people who want to update the Wiki with new and updated content. :)
* '''''good''''' Kotlin or Java developers with prior experience in OOP.
* good theoretical electrical engineers who are familiar with MNA, and are very familiar with Thevenin, Norton, and other systems.

==How can I contact the developers? | Is there a community of people like me?==

There are multiple ways to contact the developers. The easiest is to join either the IRC or the Discord (they are mirrored).

===Online Chat===

* Discord: https://discord.gg/invite/EMGqwbv
* IRC: #electricalage on Rizon

===Bugs and Code Submissions===

If there are bugs in the code, create an issue on the Electrical Age GitHub: https://github.com/Electrical-Age/ElectricalAge/issues
If you want to submit changes, go there, clone down the code, make the changes, and then make a pull request. Feel free to ask for help.

===Direct Email Contact===

Should you need to directly contact a developer in private for some reason, you can email [mailto:eln@ja13.org eln@ja13.org]. Understand that the email may be shared with other developers.
