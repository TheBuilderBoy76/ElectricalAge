}}Electrical Breakers are used to prevent the overloading, and consequently exploding, of cables.  They are useful in high-risk power situations, and can be particularly useful directly after a set of [[Turbine|turbines]] to prevent too much power from being drawn into the network.  Due to the fact they require an [[Overvoltage Protection Chip|overvoltage protection chip]], an [[Overheating Protection Chip|overheating protection chip]], and a [[Relay|high voltage relay]], they are somewhat expensive to make.

==Usage==
If a cable gets too hot, due to too much current being passed through, the breaker will trip and cut off the connection.  The breaker also allows the setting of a voltage range.  If the voltage on the cable reaches either limit, the breaker will also trip.  The breaker's GUI includes a manual button to turn the breaker on or off, similar to a [[Switch|switch]]  Note that turning the breaker on while the cable connected to the breaker is outside the set operating limits will cause the breaker to trip again, preventing accidental explosions.  Also, the cable slot in the GUI is for the breaker's internal use.  This does not mean the breaker will connect only to this type of cable, rather the breaker uses the statistics of this cable to calculate when to cut off.  This means that putting a high voltage cable with low amperage rating on a low voltage circuit with high amperage rating will cause the internal cable to heat up and the breaker to trip, even if the surrounding cables are fine.  This also means that the internal cable is susceptible to overvoltage explosions if the wrong cable is used or the breaker is set incorrectly.
