The '''Wind Turbine''' provides power of 160W at ~50v (Depending On Wind Power) Can be connected to other blocks via [[Cable]].
It's one of the simplest forms of generating power

<b>Wind Turbine</b>
In Order to craft wind turbine, you will need:
3x Iron Plate
1xElectrical Motor
1xMachine Block

==Usage==


===Connection===
[[File:Connection.png|frameless|left]]
As you can see, Wind turbine only has a connector for power cables (50V) at it's back. For voltages higher than 50V, you can use a [[Transformer]].

===Positioning===
The Higher, The Better.
Try to position your Wind Turbine As high as it is possible (on a hill or build a tower)
The wind speed peaks at Y100 so if you want optimal performance, build that high.
Make sure that nothing obstructs airflow:
No blocks either at the front, or the back of a Windmill
(tip: Power generation is higher during rain or storm)
REMEMBER:160W of power is the maximum of it.The real power of it is about 15-35w.Sometimes higher,but really rare.Very unstable!
