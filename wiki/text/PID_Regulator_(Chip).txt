A PID (proportional–integral–derivative regulator or controller) can be used to control ANY process in EA. You can configure the Kp, Ki and Kd constants of the regulator (GUI).

Without basic knowledge of how a regulation actually works, it might be quite hard to use. To be secure side, just play with the Kp factor and let Ki and Kd 0.
