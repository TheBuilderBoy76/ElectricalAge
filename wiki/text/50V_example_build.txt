This is the first and simplest setup, a player can start with in survival mode.

It's required for obtaining advanced elements, which are needed in order to progress ingame.

== Setup ==
A [[50V Heat Turbine]] generates power by exploiting the temperature difference between a hot and a cold side.
The hot side is marked with a red square and the cold side with a blue one.

We can use a [[Stone Heat Furnace]] to apply heat to one side and a few [[Thermal Dissipator|Small Thermal Dissipators]] to cool the other one down.

Up to two [[Combustion Chamber]] upgrades can be placed inside a [[50V Heat Turbine]], to improve it's efficiency. Valid fuels are the same as for the vanilla furnace.

In this example we'll use charcoal, since it's a very common solid fuel.

After setting the furnace up, we connect a [[50V Macerator]] using [[Low Voltage Cable]] to the [[50V Heat Turbine]].

== Using machines == 
[[File:Macerator-Interface.png|thumb|Macerator Interface|right]]
To reach optimal performance of a consumer device, keep the voltage supply bar in the green area, by using a control gauge next to the heat furnace.<br />
If you do this by hand, then it can take quite some work! Move to the next section for the automatic way.

For this example, we will use a [[50V Macerator]], but the process is the same for all other machines.

Since the voltage drops, when the Macerator is under a load, you'll need to increase the heat production of the [[50V Heat Turbine]], to counteract it.<br />
After you remove the load, the furnace will generate too much heat and it might explode.<br />
So, you will need to decrease the heat.

You can also know if the macerator is in the optimal voltage by listening to the sound it makes.<br />
The volume and pitch can tell you, if the macerator is running at it's optimal rate.

== Analogic control ==
[[File:Stone-Heat-Furnace-with-Analogic-Control.png|300px|thumb|right|Stone Heat Furnace with analogic control]]

Instead of controlling the temperature by hand, you can use an [[Analogic Regulator]] to keep it steady.

Use the Temperature gauge to set what temperature you want. 250-300 degrees corresponds to roughly
50V in our case. The Analogic regulator will use the Control gauge to try to 
keep the temperature as close as possible to the desired temperature (called "set point").

== External control ==
[[File:Electrical-Probe-50V-Example.png|300px|thumb|right|[[Electrical Probe]] example for 50V build]]
Alternately, we can control the furnace by directly measuring the voltage on the line and adjusting temperature automatically.

# Right click on the [[Electrical Probe]] and set measurement to '''Voltage''' (default)
# In the first input field (100% output) set the value to <code>50</code>
# In the second input field (0% output) set the value to <code>55</code>
# Place a single [[Low Voltage Cable]] in the bottom right corner of the probe interface (so that it connects with the rest of the wire)
# Connect the probe to the furnace using a [[Signal Cable]]
# Set the Heat furnace to accept External Control (click once on the button labeled Internal Control)

This should keep wire voltage neatly at ~50V. Use of External control is important in more complex builds.

== Finish ==

We can expand out our heat furnaces and heat turbines, so that there are 3 in a row.
This is the maximum that can safely be put on a single 50V wire without over-powering it.

(It can sometimes make sense to add more, but that may need more sophisticated control)

* Heat turbines allow electricity to pass between them (so no separate cables are required)
* Heat furnaces allow a signal to pass between them too (so no extra signal wires are needed).

Finally, we add the other machines needed to continue with next tutorials.

[[File:Example_50V_10.png|800px]]

These are, from left to right:
* [[50V Magnetizer]]
* [[50V Compressor]]
* [[50V Plate Machine]]
* [[50V Macerator]]


You can consider adding [[Machine Booster]]s to make your machines faster, but be careful not to draw too much power though!

== Where to go next ==

In theory, you should be able to make parts for any of the other '''[[Examples]]'''.
At 50V that is going to take some time though. 

After you make enough [[Alloy Plates]], [[Advanced Motors]] and [[Advanced Machine Blocks]], you can move on to '''[[200V example build]]'''.
