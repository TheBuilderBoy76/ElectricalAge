The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOR_gate NOR gate] is a digital logic gate that implements logical NOR . A 1 (high) output results if all
of the inputs to the gate are 0 (low); if at least one of the inputs is 1 (high), a 0 (low) output
results. NOR is the result of the negation of the OR operator.

NOR is a functionally complete operation like the NAND gate.

If no signal is connected to an input pin, the input is read as 0 (low). This is done by internal
pull-down resistors that pull the signal to low in the absence of an input signal. Using this
mechanism the NOR gate can be used with 2 or 3 inputs in the exact same way.

Play with the 3 buttons to see the function of the NOR gate. You will see that the output is only
1 (high) if all 3 inputs are 0 (low), in any other case the output will be 0 (low).
