== Usage ==
The generator works almost exactly the same way as the heat turbine does, only it converts the motion from a rotating shaft into electricity rather than heat moving through a turbine. It also has the ability to convert back, to keep the voltage and rotation speed in check. If possible, avoid allowing electricity to pass back into the generator unless a spin-up is intended since dramatic losses will occur.

==lights==

The generator has lights along the side.
* Red: generator is drawing power
* Green: Generator is providing power.


== Efficiency ==

When converting electricity into shaft power, only 75% of the power actually goes into creating motion. The other way around, converting shaft power to electricity, is 95% efficient.
