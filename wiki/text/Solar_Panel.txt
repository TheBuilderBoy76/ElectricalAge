Solar panels convert sunlight energy into electrical energy. In the morning and the evening the panels are less effective. There are two types of solar panels - Solar Panel (Static) and Rotating Solar Panel.

Rotating Solar Panel can track sun movement and produce electricity more effectively than static panel. In order for it to follow the sun, a [[Solar Tracker]] is needed. It can also be set manually if one cannot obtain the resources to make the tracker.

==Usage and behavior==

Solar panels can't be covered with any blocks, otherwise it won't produce as much electricity.

You can connect Solar Panels in series or in parallel. A single Solar Panel can produce 14.8v, which is not enough to power any 50v devices.

===Serial connection===

When Solar Panels are connected in series, the voltage adds up. For example, 3 panels connected in series can produce 44.4V of electricity.

===Parallel connection===

In this type of connection the panels produces the same voltage but it have more available power.

The panels in parallel connection can deliver only 14.8V but you can connect it in serial-parallel to produce more voltage and more power.
