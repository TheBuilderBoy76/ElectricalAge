The simplest possible logic function is the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverter_(logic_gate) NOT function].

In digital logic, an inverter or NOT gate is a logic gate which implements logical negation. An
inverter circuit outputs a voltage representing the opposite logic-level to its input. Its main
function is to invert the input signal applied. If the applied input is low then the output becomes
high and vice versa.

Logic gates in EA operate at fixed voltage levels corresponding to a logical 0 or 1. A voltage of
less than 10V is considered as a logical 0 (low), a voltage above 30V is considered as a logical 1
(high). Voltages in-between 10V and 30V are can not be determined reliable as a 0 or a 1, so the
considered input signal oscillates randomly between 0 and 1.

Push the signal switch in order to see the NOT chips function. The output signal is always the
opposite of the input signal.
