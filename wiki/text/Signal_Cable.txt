}}Signal Cables are used to transport electrical signals generated by various blocks in Electrical Age.  Signal cables can transmit both digital and analog signals.  These signals can be used directly to control devices such as [[Relay|relays]], [[Stone Heat Furnace|heat furnaces]], [[Signal Processor|signal processors]], etc.  Through these mechanisms signal cables can be wired to control generator systems, lighting circuits, mob farms, traps, and numerous other applications.

==Usage==
Signal cables follow the same placing rules as [[Electrical Cables|electrical cables]].  Signal cables will not connect to electrical cables, making it safe to run them next to high-voltage lines.  Signal cables do not have an internal resistance, therefore cable length can be ignored when creating circuits.  Devices that interact with signal cables all have a specific side for cable output.  If a device does not automatically connect to a neighboring signal cable after placement, it must be rotated by right-clicking it with a [[Wrench|wrench]].

==Technical==
The value, or strength, of the signal in a signal cable is represented by a percentage.  At 0% the cable has a value of 0V, while at 100% the cable has a value of 50V.  [[Signal Switch|Signal switches]], [[Signal Button|signal buttons]], and similar digital devices emit either 0V or 50V, depending on their state.  Other devices, like [[Electrical Probe|electrical probes]], can transmit any value between 0V to 50V.  A collection of connected signal cables behaves as a network.  If multiple signal sources are connected to this network the cables will take the average value of all the sources.  This means that if you have two signal switches connected to a single network, and only one of those switches is on, the network will have a value of 50%, or 25V.
