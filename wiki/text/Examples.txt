Unlike some other mods that offer "magic" or "all-in-one blocks", Electrical Age consists of many different kinds of parts that work together. Just like real world electric circuits. Electrical Age starts relatively simple, but the largest builds can be quite challenging, even for skilled players and industrial control experts.

For players in large modpacks, all the useful parts of electrical age can be unlocked at the 800V tier, though there are good things before then. If you're careful and a little smart about it, you don't have to be an expert to get there. 
On the other hand, if you're a diehard and want a serious challenge, you might want to give the very high voltage [[Gas Turbine]]s and [[Steam Turbine]]s a try.
If you want to go to the extreme, try a [[Parallelized turbine example]] type-system, though you'll need to be endgame in the mod before you do.

Here are some example systems (with power generation and machines). Your system doesn't have to be exactly like this. These are just some examples to get you started. After you get comfortable with the basics, you can design your own systems!

If you get stuck and don't know how to craft or obtain some items, you can always consult with in-game wiki (default key is X).
