The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AND_gate AND gate] is a basic digital logic gate that implements logical conjunction. A 1 (high) output
results only if all of the three inputs to the AND gate are 1 (high). If any of the inputs is
0 (low), a 0 (low) output results.

If no signal is connected to an input pin, the input is read as 1 (high). This is done by internal
pull-up resistors that pull the signal to high in the absence of an input signal. Using this
mechanism the AND gate can be used with 2 or 3 inputs in the exact same way.

Play with the 3 buttons to see the function of the AND gate. You will see that the output is only
1 (high) if all 3 inputs are 1 (high).
