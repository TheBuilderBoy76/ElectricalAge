The macerator is a [[machine]] that grinds things.

= Recipes =

The macerator grinds down various ores into two dust, and various ingots into one dust, including most ores/ingots/dusts registered by other mods. This is a form of ore duplication which can be accessed from the very early game!

Additionally:

* Macerating sand yields one [[Silicon Dust|silicon dust]] per block.
* Macerating coal yields two [[Coal_Dust|coal dust]] per block.
* Macerating cobblestone yields one gravel per block.
* Macerating gravel yields one flint per block.
* Macerating dirt yields one sand per block.

= Power usage =

When not upgraded, the 50V/200V macerators have an internal resistance of 12.5 Ohms and 100 Ohms respectively, drawing 4 and 2 Amperes respectively. With the capacity of [[Low Voltage Cable|low]] and [[Medium Voltage Cable|medium]] voltage cables, it is safe to put only up to 5 macerators on an otherwise-unoccupied circuit.

You can use a [[Machine Booster]] to speed up the '''Macerator''', but this will come at the cost of increased power usage. Details about power usage and machine boosters can be found in the [[Machine Booster]] page.
