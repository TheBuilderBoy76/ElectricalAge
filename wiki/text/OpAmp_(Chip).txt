An OP (Operational Amplifier or OpAmp) is a DC-coupled high-gain electronic voltage amplifier with a differential input and, usually, a single-ended output.

Without external components like resistors, capacitors or inductors, it's high gain allow it only to be used as a comparator. A comparator basically compares two voltages - in the case of an OpAmp the + input voltage and the - input voltage. If the + voltage is higher than the - voltage, the output of the OpAmp is 50V (1 or true), if the - voltage is higher than the + input voltage, then the output is 0V (0 or false).

In the current version of the mod resistors, capacitors and inductors for signal voltage do not exist yet, so the use of an OpAmp is limited to comparator function.
