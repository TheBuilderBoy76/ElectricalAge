The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate XOR gate] is a digital logic gate that implements an exclusive or; that is, an output of
1 (high) results if one or all three of the inputs to the gate are 1 (high). If all inputs are
0 (low) or just two of them are 1 (high), a 0 (low) output results.

A way to remember XOR is "the number of 1 (high) inputs is odd".

If no signal is connected to an input pin, the input is read as 0 (low). This is done by internal
pull-down resistors that pull the signal to low in the absence of an input signal. Using this
mechanism the XOR gate can be used with 2 or 3 inputs in the exact same way.

Play with the 3 buttons to see the function of the XOR gate. You will see that the output is only
1 (high) if one or all three inputs are 1 (high), in any other case the output will be 0 (low).
