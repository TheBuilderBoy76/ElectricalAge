== Start with a 200V power unit ==

From the '''[[200V example build]]''', we know how to make a 200V power unit.

For this example, you could hook up to an existing 200V line, or make a new power
unit specially for the [[Autominer]]. 

There are even better ways to get power to an autominer, but those are outside the scope
of this example.

== Transform up to 800V ==
We can use a transformer to transform 200V up to 800V.

keep an eye on where the green square and yellow square are in the world
in our case yellow is on the 200V side, and green on the 800V side.

* Place 4 [[High Voltage Cable]]s in the green side.
* Place 1 [[Medium Voltage Cable]] in the yellow side.
* Place a [[Ferromagnetic Core]] of any kind in the middle slot. 

Now the transformer will transform at a ratio of 1:4 . (and 200*4=800)

== Set up autominer ==


Place the Autominer where you want to mine. Use high voltage cables to connect it to the Transformer.

* The Autominer will mine down to bedrock in a 10 block radius circle.
* The Autominer will dig an open shaft in the middle, but otherwise replaces everything it digs with cobblestone.

''(If you happen to be familiar with the [https://wiki.aidancbrady.com/wiki/Digital_Miner mekanism digital miner]; the autominer is quite comparable. In comparison: it comes pre-configured for the most common use case; it's cheaper; and it is typically somewhat slower.)''

* Place an [[Electrical Drill]] (any kind) in the left slot (top right)
* Place a stack of [[Mining Pipe]] in the right slot (top right)
* Leave silk touch off. In this configuration you may not have enough power to use that.

* Place a chest (or some other inventory block) at the rear of the autominer.

== Breaker (Optional) ==

Use [[Breaker]]s early and often. They will check for overvolt and overheat conditions and hopefully switch off the line before anything really bad happens.

In this case the breaker is also a convenient way to turn the autominer on and off

* Set max voltage to 250V (you can go a little bit over line max voltage without too bad things happening)

==Finally ==
* Feed your 200V powerunit some form of fuel (like charcoal)
* Switch on the breaker
* watch as the autominer slowly, but surely, digs up ore for you!

* With an operational autominer, life at a survival base can be more relaxed
* You will still need to occasionally move the autominer, it's no silver bullet.
