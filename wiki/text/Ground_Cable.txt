}}Ground Cables are used to provide a negative terminal for [[Battery|batteries]] in circuits.  By definition, they are a constant 0V.  This makes connecting them to live circuits unwise, as the high current load can easily overheat the wire, causing it to explode.  A safe circuit discharging mechanism can be created using the combination of a [[Electrical Probe|electrical probe]] and a [[Relay|relay]] to control the discharge.  This can be useful in the case of a power surge in a network.
