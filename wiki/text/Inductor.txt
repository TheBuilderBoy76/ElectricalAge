Inductors are a current source which tries to keep current flowing through it consistently by storing electricity when current is high, and discharging when current is low. When current passes through it, it will store a little of it within a magnetic field at the cost of some voltage. If the current dies out, the inductor try to keep the flow going by releasing its its charge. If the inductor has nowhere to put its current, for example in the case of a disconnection, it will fail. In real life, a failure causes an effect called Inductive Kickback, which is a result of the magnetic field collapsing; creating dangerously aggressive voltage swings as a result. Thankfully, Electrical Age does not model this and the stored power will simply be lost instead.

These require copper wires and a Ferromagnetic Core. The amount of copper wire inserted will set its inductance and the core will determine how much energy is wasted from the process.

[[File:Simple Demonstration of Inductor.png|thumb|When the circuit is open, the power flows through the main loop, accumulating charge. When the circuit is closed, it will loop around the secondary wire until it runs out of power.]]

The Inductor will store its Henry value / 2 x Amps x Amps as Joules. This means the higher the current you pass through an inductor, the more charge per amp you will be able to store within it. Using low voltage as to allow higher currents is a good way to get the most storage out of your inductor.

==Tips on usage ==

Inductors will store a LOT of power if you give them a very fast current. If you want to use an inductor for storage purposes, be sure to step up the current as much as you can get away with. This comes at the cost of speed as a low voltage inductor will charge/discharge very slowly. Remember to step the current back down before reintroducing the power into your network, or you may instantly incinerate your wires with the tremendous amperage.

==Installing your Inductor==

Once you place down the Inductor, you still need to install a few components for it to run. First, place in a feromagnetic core. Higher quality cores will waste less energy. Next, add in copper cables to set the inductance. You can install up to 19 cables for a max of 100H.
