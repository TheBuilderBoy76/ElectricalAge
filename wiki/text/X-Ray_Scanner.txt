The X-ray Scanner is a very useful item. It assists you in finding ores and, in some situations, other blocks. This is very useful, especially for people who like to mine. But there is a "small" downside. The scanner runs on [[Portable Battery|batteries]], and as you (should) know, batteries don't last forever. So it is important that you keep atleast 1 Portable Battery Pack with you at all times if you're planing on using the scanner for a prolonged duration.

==How to charge the X-Ray Scanner==
It's quite simple really. To use it, you first need to make sure you have at least one of the following items that are charged to some degree: '''[[Portable Battery]], [[Portable Battery|Portable Battery Pack]], [[Portable Condensator]], [[Portable Condensator|Portable Condensator Pack]], [[Portable Electrical Mining Drill]], [[Portable Electrical Axe]], or [[ECoal Helmet]]/[[ECoal Chestplate|Chestplate]]/[[ECoal Leggings|Leggings]]/[[ECoal Boots|Boots]].''' Once you have at least one of those things, make sure both the X-Ray Scanner and whatever you are using to charge it is in your inventory (I recommend putting them both in your hotbar) then press C (It is important that you don't have any other mod's keybindings interfering with Electrical-Age's keybindings). The power left in the whatever portable electrical device you have should go into X-Ray Scanner.  

==How to use the X-Ray Scanner==
After it's been charged (read above for information on how to charge it) right click, and it should power on after being initialized. On the screen of the X-Ray Scanner you will probably see a bunch of orange to red and blue stuff. These next few things are very important to remember. <u>'''Blue is Air/Nothing, Yellow and Green are Ores, Red is Dirt/Grass, and Orange blocks are ore(s) that are behind a block.'''</u> Now you're set!
