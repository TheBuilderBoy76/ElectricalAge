The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)#D_flip-flop JK flip-flop] can save the actual input states like the d flip-flop upon triggered by the clock
input. If the input J is 1 (high) and K is 0 (low) during a clock pulse, the output becomes 1 (high).
If J is 0 (low) and K is 1 (high) during the pulse, the output becomes 0 (low). If both inputs are
0 (low) during the clock pulse, the state is maintained. If both inputs are 1 (high) the input is
toggled if a rising edge was detected at the clock input.

If no signals are wired to either the J or the K input, these inputs are read as 1 (high).
This is done by internal pull-up resistors that pull the signal to low in the absence of
an input signal. This has as result that the JK flip-flop toggles it's output value on each
positive clock edge.

If no signal is connected to an input pin, the input is read as 0 (low). This is done by internal
pull-down resistors that pull the signal to low in the absence of an input signal. Using this
mechanism the NOR gate can be used with 2 or 3 inputs in the exact same way.

works.
