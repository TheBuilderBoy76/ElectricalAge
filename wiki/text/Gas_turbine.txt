== Accepted Fuels ==

=== Gasoline-equivalents ===

These Light oils can be used by any combustion engine, such as the fuel generator.
The ones on this list are all pretty close to each other in energy content.

* '''Syngas''' (Advanced Generators), provides 20 MJ/m3
* '''fuel''' (Buildcraft), provides 41 MJ/kg, with a density of 0.77 kg/l
* '''rc ethanol''' (Rotarycraft), provides 26.8 MJ/kg, with a density of 0,79 kg/l
* '''biofuel''' (Minefactory reloaded), provides 22,68 MJ/l, with a density of 0.786 kg/l
* '''bioethanol''' (Forestry), provides 22,68 MJ/l
* '''gasoline''' (PneumaticCraft), provides 34,2 MJ/l, with a density of 0.755 kg/L
* '''kerosene''' (Pneumaticcraft), provides 34,8 MJ/l
* '''lpg''' (Pneumaticcraft), provides 46 MJ/kg, with a density of density = 0.54 kg/l
* '''fuelgc''' (Galacticcraft), provides 41 MJ/kg, with a density of 0.77 kg/l
* '''lightoil''' (Magneticraft), provides 42.6 MJ/kg, with a density of 0.83 kg/l

=== Burnable gases ===

True to their real life counterparts, Gas Turbines can burn pretty much any combustible fluid. Here are a list of fuels which will only burn in the Gas Turbine.

* '''naturalgas''' (Magneticraft), provides 36 MJ/m3
