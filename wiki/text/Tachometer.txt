The tachometer is an axle speed measurement tool. It outputs a voltage to a [[Signal Cable]] based on the configured low and high speed input.

== GUI ==

[[File:Tachometer-gui.png]]

The top box sets the configuration of what the speed is that outputs 50v.

The bottom box sets the configuration of what the speed is that outputs 0v.

Between those points, it will automatically ramp the voltage in the correct way. Outside of that range, it will output the extreme voltage on that side of the bound.

== Example ==

=== Ex 1: reversed voltage to speed ratios ===

Top: 400 rad/s

Bottom: 600 rad/s
