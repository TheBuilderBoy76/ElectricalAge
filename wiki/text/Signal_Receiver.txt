}}Remote Signal Receiver is used to receive wireless electrical signal transmitted by [[Signal Transmitter]] or [[Wireless Button]].
To proper work you need to set specified channel which the Receiver will work on.<br />
Signal Receiver has indicator light which determines connection status.

==Behavior==
It has menu where you can set work mode. The receiver has three work modes - biggest value, smallest value or toggle.

===Biggest value===

When you use multiple wireless signal sources which have different signal values, the receiver set in this mode will receive only the biggest one.<br />
In this example both [[Signal Transmitter]]s are working on the same channel.<br />
Receiver '''A''' is set in '''Biggest value''' mode and it's receiving 75% signal. <br />
Receiver '''B''' is set in '''Smallest value''' mode and it's receiving 25% signal.

===Smallest value===
When you use multiple wireless signal sources which have different signal values, the receiver set in this mode will receive only the smallest one.<br />
It works as shown in example above.

===Toggle value===
In this mode the receiver will react as a switch. To switch it's state you have to deliver only short pulse of signal from, for example, [[Wireless Button]]. <br />
You can use this mode to control one [[Relay]] by multiple [[Wireless Button]]s.
