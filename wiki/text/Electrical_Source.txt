Creative Electrical Sources are used to provide a constant voltage for electrical circuits.  They also provide almost infinite power, with the only limit to their output being the properties of the cable or device they are connected to.  They are uncraftable, and are only available through the creative mode GUI.  Since they produce infinite power and a set voltage, they are a useful teaching tool.

=== Trivia ===

* The ground pin is secretly just an Electrical Source set to 0v.
* To prevent infinite current, Electrical Sources all have a minimal amount of resistance connected to them, before connecting to the wires or other components. This is why 3.2kV to ground is 128kA, and not infinite current.

Since R=V/I:
<pre>
R = 3.2kV/128kA = 0.025Î©
</pre>

I'm not actually sure if ground pins have the resistor in them, they probably do.
