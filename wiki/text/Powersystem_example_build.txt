Here i you can see my Creative World, i have created with the ELN-Mod<br />


== Overview ==
<br />
# power plant with solar panels, wind turbines and water turbines
# more wind turbines and water collector
# village
# Gasturbine powerplant (not attached to power system at the moment)
# desert village

== Power plant renewable energy ==
<br />
<big>According to 1. in the Overview image</big><br />
<br />
This is the Power plant that produces 100% green energy, it contains some batteries to compensate power fluctuations caused by the weather and the day/night cycle.
<br />

<br />
===== Solar power =====
<br />
4 Solar panels in series are needed to get the same voltage as the wind turbines and water turbines.<br />

[[File:Powersystem example 3.png|800px]]<br />
<br />
I made a daylight controlled grounding for the Solarpanels,<br />
because they had day and night the same voltage. Dont forget to add a diode to prevent current flow from the powersystem back to the ground.<br />
[[File:Powersystem example 4.png|800px]]<br />
I used a Resistor of 56Ω.<br /><br />
<br />
===== Wind power =====
<br />
Wind turbines<br />
[[File:Powersystem example 6.png|800px]]<br />
<br />
The Building for the Wind power, it has an anemometer above it to measure the wind speed.<br />
[[File:Powersystem example 7.png|800px]]<br />
<br />
Inside the Building i have Data loggers for power, voltage, current and wind speed.<br />
Grounding makes here no sense, because the wind blows day and night<br />
[[File:Powersystem example 8.png|800px]]<br />
<br />
===== Water power =====
<br />
<big>According to 2. in the Overview image</big><br />
<br />
Here the Water for the Water turbines gets collected, this is not necessary for the Turbines to work, but it looks nicer.<br />
above there are more Wind turbines.<br />
[[File:Powersystem example 9.png|800px]]<br />
<br />
Now let's look inside the Waterpowerhouse.<br />
[[File:Powersystem example 10.png|800px]]<br />
<br />
Here i have some Data loggers too.<br />
[[File:Powersystem example 11.png|800px]]<br />
<br />
The lights are fed with a extra water turbine and batteries, to have light even when the Power plant is down.<br />
The Batteries are located downstairs, where the Transformer and the Grounding for the Turbines are located too.<br />
[[File:Powersystem example 12.png|800px]]<br />
<br />
This Resistor has 180Ω, when i close the water inflow. A relay closes and connect the Waterturbines to the ground.<br />
[[File:Powersystem example 13.png|600px]]<br />
<br />
<br />
===== Batteries =====
<br />
Because renewable energies hasn't the same power all the time, day night cycle, wind speed, more or less water.<br />
I built a little battery bank to compensate these differences.<br />
<br />
[[File:Powersystem example 14.png|800px]]<br />
<br />
There are 40 Life oriented batteries, you can see the setup in the pictures below<br />
[[File:Powersystem example 16.png|800px]]<br />
<br />
[[File:Powersystem example 18.png|800px]]<br />
<br />
===== Transformer Station =====
<br />
To provide the produced power, a Transformer Station is needed.<br />
Here the voltage is transformed up to 13kV, and fed in the Power lines<br />

== Villages ==
<br />
<big>According to 3. and 5. in the Overview image</big><br />
<br />
<br />
The Power lines from above with the Power plant (1. from overview) at the right side, and the Village (3. from overview) at the left side.<br />
[[File:Powersystem example 20.png|800px]]<br />
<br />
The desert Village (5. from overview)<br />

== Build it for yourself ==
<br />
Here comes a step by step image tutorial how to make a power system.
