}}Hubs are used to route [[Electrical Cables|electrical cables]] and [[Signal Cable|signal cables]].  By accessing the GUI the direction  of the electricity flow can be chosen.  This allows cables to be crossed, or to be put in line with other cables of different voltages.

After placing the hub, right-click it to open its GUI.  Here you can adjust the direction of electricity flow by clicking the paths on and off.  Paths don't have to be mutually exclusive; you can make a Y or T-junction if you want.  The hub won't connect to any wires near it without a wire in the slot in the GUI.  Unfortunately, the hub doesn't care <i>what</i> wire it connects to once you put a wire in the slot.  If you accidentally place a low voltage wire in the slot next to a high voltage circuit, the hub will connect and explode.  Be careful when working around high voltage differences.
