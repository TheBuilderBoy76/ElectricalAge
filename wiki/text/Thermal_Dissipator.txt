Thermal Dissipators are blocks that are used to cool down [[Heat Turbine]]s.

They can be passive, and remove heat at a slower speed, or you can have 50v and 200v thermal dissipators, which actively remove heat using a fan.

[[File:200V-Active-Thermal-Dissipator.png|300px|thumb|right|200V Active Thermal Dissipator with cooling side (on the left) and [[Electrical Cables|Electrical Cable]] side (on the right)]]
Place the dissipator with the cooling side facing cold side of the [[Heat Turbine]].

It's required to provide electricity source for active dissipators.

50V/50W for Small Active Thermal Dissipator and 200V/60W for the 200V Active Thermal Dissipator.
