}}The DC-DC Converter (previously known as the "Transfomer") is a device that can step voltage up and therefore lower amperage and vice versa. It is used everytime you need to connect devices or generators with a difference between their voltage to each other.

In Electrical Age the transformer works with DC voltage but in real life it works only with AC.

==Behavior and usage==

To use the DC-DC converter correctly you have to put a specified amount of wires on each winding and the [[Ferromagnetic Core]]. 

There is primary and secondary winding but you can swap it. Each winding is marked with a green or yellow rectangle.

Transformer can multiply or divide voltage according to this formula :<br />
 ''V<sub>sec</sub> = (V<sub>pri</sub> · n<sub>sec</sub>) / n<sub>pri</sub>''
V<sub>sec</sub> = Voltage at secondary winding<br />
V<sub>pri</sub> = Voltage at primary winding<br />
n<sub>sec</sub> = Amount of wires in secondary winding<br />
n<sub>pri</sub> = Amount of wires in primary winding

===Example===

In this example the green winding has 1 [[Electrical Cables|Low Voltage Cable]] and voltage on it is '''50V'''.<br />
The yellow winding have 4 [[Electrical Cables|Medium Voltage Cables]] and according to above formula, the voltage will be '''200V'''.<br />
 ''V<sub>sec</sub> = (50V · 4) / 1''
 ''V<sub>sec</sub> = 200V''
