Ecoal armor is a uniquely powerful set of armor which will protect you from harm at the cost of electricity but is unreliable for heavy combat. It is more effective for negating the day-to-day bumps and bruises one may get playing normally.

Since the armor has natural capacitance, it can store a little energy in its buffer. It can then use this energy to negate any damage taken by the player at the cost of its buffer. The more damage you take, the more energy gets drained. If this buffer drains you will lose not only the additional protection that the set provides, but also the normal armor value! This means if you run out of energy your armor set will not stop any damage at all, so don't let this happen in combat.

In order for your armor to be practical in combat, it's a good idea to carry some batteries and capacitors in your inventory. While holding these, they will charge your armor, allowing you to take multiple hard hits before losing your armor's effectiveness. Batteries are slow to charge your armor but last a very long time, while capacitors can charge your armor nearly instantly but have far less capacity. It's up to the user to determine which power storage method is worth using and balance inventory space requirements for how much damage you are expecting to take. It's also possible to use both types of storage to benefit from both's advantages while limiting their drawbacks.

Generally speaking, using coal to create diamonds and making diamond armor is a more effective use of your resources, but the Ecoal set is still remarkably useful in niche situations where large amounts of damage need to be tanked at once, or when lots of minor damage needs to be completely avoided. Ecoal armor also reduces all damage taken, so it might be useful in situations where normal armor won't protect against a certain type of damage.
