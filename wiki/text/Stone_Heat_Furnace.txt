The '''Stone Heat Furnace''' provides heat either direct to other blocks or via [[Copper Thermal Cable]]. They are typically used to create a heat gradient for [[Heat Turbine|Turbine]].

==Interface==
[[File:Stone Heat Furnace Interface.png]]

=== Internal/External Control (A) ===

If set to internal control, you can move the Gauges yourself. If set to external, the Gauges are controlled by a signal coming in over a [[Signal Cable]].

=== Take/Decline Fuel (B) ===

If under Internal control, this controls whether the Furnace will consume fuel. If it is left off, the furnace won't consume any fuel.

=== Regulator Slot (C) ===

Normally only the Control Gauge can be controlled. If you have a [[Regulator]] installed, you can set a particular temperature for the furnace to hold. The [[Regulator|Analog Regulator]] does so gradually, finding the exact right control setting, while the 1%/10% regulators work approximately like a standard thermostat.

=== Combustion Chamber Slot (D) ===

At least 1 [[Combustion Chamber]] is needed for the Stone Heat Furnace to work. Add a second to improve efficiency.

=== Fuel Slot (E) ===

Insert combustible fuel here, such as coal or charcoal.

=== Temperature Gauge (F) ===

Shows the current temperature of the furnace. Requires a regulator to be able to be controlled.

===Control Gauge (G) ===

Sets the rate at which to burn fuel in %.  At a setting under 10%, no fuel will be burned, and the Furnace is effectively off.

==Signal Behavior==
Signals will adjust the Control gauge. The signal strength directly correlates to its position on the bar.
